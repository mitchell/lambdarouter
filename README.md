This package will become a fully featured AWS Lambda function router, able to respond to HTTP, Schedule, Cognito, and SNS events. It will also support middleware interfacing.

So far it includes functionality for API Gateway. Check out the GoDoc Reference to see how to instantiate a router and
create endpoints.
